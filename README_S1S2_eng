General information
---------------------
The archive contains 4 folders and a file S1S2Controller.jar, which is the core of the system.
- 'lib' contains the libraries necessary to run the system.
- 'config' contains the configuration files. Changes should be restricted to the file ‘user.properties’.
- 'files' contains static files required to run the system. In particular, this folder contains:
	[1] a folder 'database' with the dump of the database used by the system.
	[2] a folder 'knowledge_base', with the files used by S1
	[3] a folder 'ontology', with the files used by S2
	[4] a folder 'temp_files' which will contain the xml file of the stimulus used at runtime.
- The ’examples' folder contains some stimuli already encoded, and a text file with the whole list of stimuli we used in the test.


Requirements and configuration
------------------------------
In order to run the software, some additional steps are required:
- WordNet 3.0 installed on your computer;
- Create a database (e.g., by using phpmyadmin) named 'sistemas2cyc' to import the sql dump provided in 'files/database';
- Set the correct paths into the configuration file 'config/user.properties’, by following the instructions in the file. Please note that:
	[1] if the folder 'files' was not moved or changed, you do not need to change the properties 'knowledgebase.dir' and 'ontology.dir'.
	[2] the file specified in 'xmlQuery.path' performs two functions: (a) when using the Information Extraction step (see section Running, point [1]) this file will be created or overwritten to store the encoded stimulus; (b) if you don’t make use of the Information Extraction step (see section Running, point [2]) this property must contain the path to an XML file containing a stimulus already encoded, for example taken from the examples.

Running
--------
To run the system, you must first open a terminal and position itself in the folder containing the main jar file 'S1S2Controller.jar' and the folder 'config', using the command:
	> Cd path/to/directory

Two sorts execution are allowed:

[1] Full pipeline: typing the following command you will run the system by feeding it with the stimulus.
	> Java -jar S1S2Controller.jar "The big carnivorous fur with yellow and black stripes"

[2] Without information extraction: if you don’t specify the first parameter, then it is assumed that the path specified with the 'xmlQuery.path' property into the file 'config/user.properties' refers to the stimulus (XML encoding), to be analyzed by s1 and s2. The system will skip the IE step. You can run through:
	> Java -jar S1S2Controller.jar
